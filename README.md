### Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The version control systems are an essential tool for software development, and any project that requires a collaborative work and with the possibility of having versions. This activity will allow knowing the most used version control system nowadays, GIT, and its integration in a remote repository, Github for the development of Java projects (or any other technology). Github offers us a repository on the Cloud and we will integrate it with our IDE; for this we will use Eclipse in its desktop version, or Eclipse Che in the cloud.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This activity has been developed for developing the professional competence includes in the Erasmus+ project "Cloud Computing in European School".

###  Initial Level
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do this [questionnarie](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjP_ndTrMosgiWjKjKN4m38sXvkAwUbxwMB63YOevv17dscA/viewform) to asses your initial level.  
<br><br>

### Exercise no. 1: Learning GIT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Read** the [bibliography 1](https://reviblog.net/2018/03/29/tutorial-de-git-aprende-git-y-github-gitlab-de-manera-facil-rapida-y-sencilla-parte-1/) to the basics about the use of GIT. The **tutorial** is structured in 6 pages which explain the next sections:

 1. What is GIT?
 2. GIT installation.
 3. First steps: user configuration and local repository.
 4. GIT commands
 5. Branchs.
 6. Remote repository. Github
    * README
    * Update remote repository from local repository.
    * Update local repository from remote repository
    * Copy of repositories and pull requests to original repository.
<br>    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the tutorial, you must have done these **practices**:
 

 1. **Install** GIT.<br>
 > Windows: Download GitBash  <br>
 > Linux:  git install git <br>
  
 2. **Configure your user** for working with your local/remote repository.  <br>


>  git config --global user.name "nombre_usuario"   <br>
 > git config --global user.email "email_usuario" <br>
  
 3. **Create a local repository** called "**proyectoGIT**".  <br>


>  mkdir proyectoGIT  <br>
>  cd proyectoGIT   <br>
>  git init  <br>
 
 4. **Practise GIT commands** : init, add (files and folders), status, commit, log, checkout id_commit, help, diff, reset --soft/hard id_commit  


 5. Configure documents and documents type not to be managed by GIT: **.gitignore**  


 6. Create a **new branch** called "**branch2**". List branches, switch branch branch2, add documents to  branch2 and merge into **master branch**. <br>
 

> git branch branch2 <br>
>  git checkout branch2  <br>
>  git branch  <br>
>  git checkout master  <br>
>  git merge branch2  <br>
 7. Make a snapshot to your repository by naming it with a **tag**; called "**version1.0**"
> git tag version_1.0   <br>
 
 8.  Create a **Github account**.  
 


 
 9.  **Create a remote repository** in Github and called it **ProyectoGIT**.  


 10. **Import your local repository**, ProyectoGIT, to the remote repository, ProyectoGIT:  
 
>  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/ProyectoGIT.git <br>
>  git push -u origin master   <br>

 11. Modify the file **README.md** withs one information  (for example create an index about "Agencia de vuelos" project). Do these changes by editing directly the file in github.  


 12. Delete your local repository and make a **clone** from your remote repository. *Have you recovered the deleted local repository?* <br>
> git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/ProyectoGIT.git <br>

 13.  Modify a document in your local repository and update it in the remote repository <br>
> git push -u origin master <br>
 
  14. Modify the same document but in the remote repository. After doing it, actualiza el repositorio local <br>
  > git pull <br>
<br><br>

### Exercise no. 2: GIT in Eclipse
   After learning to use GIT for local and remote repositories, now it is time to integrate this technology with the Integrated Development Environment. The objective is deploy our project, our Java project for example, in a GIT repository and synchonize with a remote repository in Github in order to publish it and work in team with other developers.

   The article in the [bibliography 4](https://www.arquitecturajava.com/eclipse-git-repositorios/) explains the steps to do it.   The steps are:
   

 1. Create a Java project.
 ![Creating a Java project](/img/CreateJavaProject.png)  


 2. Create a Java Class with the typical message "Hello World".
 ![Creating a Java app](/img/CreateJavaClass.png)  


 3. Integrate the project into a GIT repository (Right botton on the project name --> Team --> Share project --> Select GIT repository location ). Note that after doing the project dissappears in the Eclipse workspace (/home/user/eclipse-workspace/ProyectoGIT and it is moved to the GIT repository folder, /home/user/repositorios-github/ProyectoGIT).  
  ![Step to integrated Java project in GIT](/img/JavaProjectinGIT.png)  
  

The final result is our project in a GIT repository:  

![The project integrated in GIT](/img/JavaProjectinGIT-2.png) 


Whe can check the new location of the Java project:
  
  ![New location for the project](/img/GitRepositoryFolder.png)


  4.Add our project to GIT ("git add") y versionar ("git commit"):  
  (/img/Eclipse-Add.png)  
    ![Project add](/img/Eclipse-Add.png)
    ![Project commit](/img/Eclipse-Commit.png)  
    




5. The GIT plugin allow to use another perspective. Open **GIT perspective**. do click on the tab 'Git Staging'.   
![Project commit](/img/Eclipse-GITPerspective.png)  

As you can see, there are serveral parts:  

  * <u>Unstaged changes</u>: files that are inside the GIT repository and they have changed. You can add the files to the stage by clicking in '+' button. This action makes a "git add"
  * <u>Staged changes</u>: files that have been add to the stage. In case you decide to follow their versions, you must do click on "Commit button".
  * <u>Commit message</u>: to describe the message for the commit (git commit -m MESSAGE)
  * <u>Commit</u>:   is the result of "git commit -m MESSAGE".
  * <u>Commit and push</u>: these button add the option to upload the changes to the remote repository.  
  


6. **Do other changes and commit them**. For example, change "Hello World" to "Bye World". Commit the change with the message "Commit 2".
![Project commit 2](/img/Eclipse-commit2.png)


  We have just realized that we need to **go back** to the initial step because we don't want the new code developed. 
![Project reset - go back -](/img/Eclipse-reset.png)


   What is the content of the file "HelloWorld.java"?  ("Hello World" again?).  Cool!  *Our Version Control System works fine!!*


7. It is the time to **upload our local repository to Github** to be shared  to other developers. 
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 1](/img/Eclipse-Push-1.png)
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 2](/img/Eclipse-Push-2.png)
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 3](/img/Eclipse-Push-3.png)
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 4](/img/Eclipse-Push-4.png)
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 5](/img/Eclipse-Push-5.png)

We can check that our local project is in Gitthub remote repository.
![Project - upload GitHub-Step 6](/img/Eclipse-Push-6.png)


8. Now the **repository will be shared to other developers**  
We are going to add collaborators to the project. Click on "Settings" in your repository 'ProyectoGIT". Then go to "Collaborators" section and add the Github username o user email.  

![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-1.png)



After this step, the other developer can access to the same repository, i.e., to the same project. The invited collaborator must go to his/her email and accept the invitation.
![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-2.png)

The new collaborator can access to the repository from his/her Github account:  
![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-3.png)

The usual situation is that the new developer wants to contribute to the project by testing new software locally; so, the next step will be to clone the repository. 
Follow the steps in [bibliography 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQNixJQQ25g). The pictures show what to do:  

Select "Clone a Git Repository and ..." from the view "Git Repositories":  

![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-4.png)

Now, we must configure the remote repository:  

![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-5.png)
The last step is to choose a local folder:
![Project - Collaborators](/img/Github-Collaborators-6.png)




Other way to do it (without using Eclipse)
> create a folder 

> git clone https://github.com/jlrod2pruebas/ProyectoGIT.git  

> Open Eclipse and import the project


From now, the new developer can work in the same project!!!

###  Final Level
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do this [questionnarie](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYfxr0NwK-qqOg-6vPN-WtizHAmeuRz5MwX6N9NXM9W3W-Cg/viewform) to asses your initial level.  





### Work methodology


 1. Collaborative team work.
 2. The class will be distributed in groups and each group have to practice the exercises proposed in this activity.
 3. The practices must be documentated.


### Documentation and exhibition
 1. Only delivery for each group.
 2. The documentation must include practices about exercises 2 and 3 and explain the relationship between GIT in Eclipse/ Eclipse Che with GIT commands. 
 3. The documentation format is a videotutorial. It must follows the guide for [videotutorials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WV89OADdWK86i5uplX4zYoLHmDxdDgc-HiDkf1QdzN4/edit?usp=sharing).
 4. These videotutoriales will be uploade to the IT Department account on YouTube.
 5. Students who have been selected for mobility must submit the documentation in English.
 6. All the groups will do a  presentation  of the activity in class.
 7. Students selected for mobility to Italy must prepare a 1-hour workshop to teach the rest of the students from the other participating centers. The objective of the workshop is that attendees learn the most theoretical aspects of GIT and doing the practices. The generated documentation must be oriented for this workshop. Suggestion: use tools such as Google Form to gather information or Kahoot to prepare interactive questions. The creativity of the presented workshop will be valued.


### Mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This activity is part of the Erasmus + project "Cloud Computing in  European schools". All students must complete it. An increase up to 1 point will be added in the final mark of the professional module where the activity is developed, provided that the grade obtained in the evaluation of the associated learning results is equal to or greater than 5.      






### Evaluation criteria evaluated
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activity will serve as an improvement / recovery of the following criteria (in addition to it was indicated in the previous section):  

  * 2d + 2e + 2f  
  * 3e + 3f + 3g + 3h  
  * 4a + 4b

This criteria mark will be increased even whether grade obtained in the evaluation of the associated learning results is equal to or greater than 4.5, but only in the case the project requested for these criterio have been developed by using GIT with, at least, 2 people in the same group.
